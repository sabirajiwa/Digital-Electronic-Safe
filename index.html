         Our innovative safe combines security with creativity by taking the shape of a water bottle.
         This safe is made with the highest quality of materials, which allows it to be discreetly and 
         functionally integrated in its surroundings. The exterior resembles a standard water bottle to ensure that 
         it is hidden from view in any environment. But there is a secure compartment hidden beneath the familiar
          facade that provides ample space for valuables such as wristwatch, documents or small electronic devices to be stored. 
          It is easy for authorised users to access the safe, which is equipped with advanced locking mechanisms, including a 
          combination lock, which ensures a high level of protection against unauthorised entry.
          Our Water Bottled Safe is an innovative and effective solution for the protection of your belongings, whether you place it 
          on a desk, shelf or carry it everywhere. All while out safe is powered by a USB type C charger and in the event of a
          power failure, the lock will automatically default to the locked position.
          All while the cost is Â£29.90.
